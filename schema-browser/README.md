# LIDE Schema Browser (P9)

A lightweight React + Vite interface for exploring JSON schemas generated by the LIDE analyzer. Point it at a directory containing `summary.json` and per-page JSON descriptors to visualize forms, fields, outputs, and metadata.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Load schemas:
   - Provide the base URL hosting `summary.json` (e.g., `./output` or `http://localhost:8080/output`).
   - Or click **Load folder** and select a local directory of JSON files produced by the analyzer.

## Build for static hosting

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The built assets are emitted to `dist/` and can be served from any static file host.
